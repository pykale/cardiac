"""Leakage-safe splitting, as splitter objects.

Splitters follow scikit-learn's shape: an object configured once, then asked to
``split`` a table as many times as needed, yielding index arrays into it. That is what
makes a split a value a caller can pass around, log, or swap for another without the
code that consumes it changing::

    splitter = CrossValidation(n_splits=5, group_by="subject_id", stratify_by=["label"])
    for split in splitter.split(cohort):
        train, val, test = (cohort.iloc[split[name]] for name in SPLIT_NAMES)

Two differences from scikit-learn, both deliberate:

* A split is a **named mapping**, not a ``(train, test)`` pair. Model selection needs a
  validation set that is not the test set, and naming the three removes any chance of a
  caller taking them in the wrong order.
* Columns are named rather than passed as parallel ``y`` and ``groups`` arrays, so a
  splitter can be built from configuration and applied to any table carrying them.

Rows sharing a ``group_by`` value always land in the same split. In a cardiac cohort
that is not a formality: a subject often contributes several recordings -- a resting
and a stress ECG, a radiograph from each of two visits -- and splitting on recordings
puts the same heart on both sides of the evaluation.

Nothing here knows a dataset. :class:`Predefined` applies an assignment somebody else
produced; where that assignment comes from -- a published split, an internal against
an external cohort, one recruiting site held out -- belongs to the dataset that defines
it.
